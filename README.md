# Kux-USB

Access Kux's filesystem under 10MB!

The default Kux contains http libraries, and other I/O. Now you can use it with minimalist tools and the filesystem.

You can use DSH and install other apps like usual.

## Setup

git clone Kux-USB.

Next: Use kux-usb.lua. It's exactly like the original Kux.
